% When using latexmk, none of the font changes (e.g. bold and emph) render to PDF. However, it is
% necessary to use latexmk to sort out all the bibliography stuff.

% Once the first version of the pdf (with defective fonts but working bibliography) has come out, 
% pdflatex should be used to get all the font variations). But using pdflatex right away does not
% create a file with a proper references environment.

% ABSTRACT environment start -----------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{abstract}

\textbf{Note} that the header you see above is not a section header, this is not actually a section, it's an environment.

\section{Introduction}\label{abstract_intro}

This is \textbf{not} the introduction to the article, it's a header inside the abstract environment.
\textbf{Note} how in the pdf the lines are numbered, even for the section headers, this is because
the abstract's sections are inside the {\tt abstract} environment. The lines of the normal section
headers (those in the rest of the file, outside of the abstract environment) are not numbered.
Notice also that normal sections have a different font face and size (unless this is changed in the
cls file, line 589.)

\section{Objective}\label{abstract_objective}

\textbf{Note} how each paragraph is indented. \textbf{This is in bold letters}. \emph{This is in
italics ( emph).}\\
This sentence---beginning at the T and ending at the period---has 100 characterss, including spaces.

Note that the line above is indented. It really shouldn't be there, and neither should this text.
It's just meant to show how the {\tt tiny} command still affects things down to this point.

 
\end{abstract} % abstract section end --------------------------------------------------------------


% Introduction section start -----------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{section}

The section header uses all upper-case letters and the ``helveticabold'' command defined in the
class file.

\textbf{Note} how under a {\tt section} command there is no indention in the first paragraph, but
there is indention in the next ones. Also \textbf{Note} how the paragraphs are justified, but the
last line looks smaller (is that {\tt raggedbottom}? or something like that? ).

This sentence---beginning at the T and ending at the period---has 100 characterss, including spaces.
This sentence---beginning at the T and ending at the period---has 100 characterss, including spaces.
This sentence---beginning at the T and ending at the period---has 100 characterss, including spaces.

\subsection{SuBsEcTiOn}%\label{}

The subsection header uses whetever case letters are entered and the ``helveticabold'' command
defined in the class file. \textbf{Note} how under all the headers except for the section one there
is indention right from the first paragraph.

\subsubsection{SubSubSection}%\label{} 

The subsubsection header uses whetever case letters are entered and the ``helvetica'' command
defined in the class file. This header \textbf{is not} bold, which makes sense if you only go down
to this level. But the header at the paragraph level \textbf{is} bold and looks bigger, and it
looks as if it's above in hierarchy and bigger than the subsubsection---this doesn't look right.
You can change this behaviour in line 599

\paragraph{Paragraph} 

The header does not seem to run-in to the text like it usually does but, rather, it behaves like
the other headers.

This sentence---beginning at the T and ending at the period---has 100 characterss, including spaces. 
This sentence---beginning at the T and ending at the period---has 100 characterss, including spaces.

\section*{Conflict of Interest Statement}

F1L1 straight-up works at WacArnold's---if you want french fries, you gots to go through him.

\section*{Author Contributions}

F1L1 determined the scope, structure, ideas, and conclusions of this study; selected, analysed, and
interpreted the data; and produced various drafts of the manuscript. F2L2 identified the need to
write this article and contributed to research, analysis, and drafting. F3L3 critically reviewed
this article, performed copy-editing duties for the final English manuscript (selected all words
and made all language decisions that affect how the article reads), processed datasets, and
designed tables. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

\section*{Funding}

This study was executed by Company 1 and partially supported by WacArnold's. 
The funding agreement ensured the authors' independence in designing the study, interpreting the
data, and writing and publishing the present study.

% \section*{Supplemental Data}

%  \href{http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#SupplementaryMaterial}
%   {Supplementary Material} should be uploaded separately on submission, if there are Supplementary
%   Figures, please include the caption in the same file as the figure. LaTeX Supplementary Material
%   templates can be found in the Frontiers LaTeX folder.

\section*{Data Availability Statement}

The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary
material, the bibliography contains links to some datasets used, further inquiries can be directed
to the corresponding author.

Below this line you should see a references section (it's not really a section but, rather, some
sort of environment created, at least partially, in the cls file). If you don't see a header that
says ``References'', 
try using \href{https://www.cantab.net/users/johncollins/latexmk/index.html}{\tt latexmk}.


% REFERENCES .......................................................................................
% \bibliographystyle{Frontiers-Harvard} 
\bibliographystyle{Frontiers-Vancouver}

% This will create the header "References" which looks just like a section header. 
% But it does not actually create a section (and thus there is bookmark on the PDF)
\bibliography{test.bib} 

% \nocite{*} 
% This line serves to include ALL the references in the .bib file, even if they have not been cited
% If you have not cited in the body of the article, you can use it to avoid having a blank "section"
% To include only some bibliographical entries, you can use \nocite{key1,key2,...,keyn} to include
% only the entries corresponding to key1,key2,...,keyn.

% If the bib file is working fine, the references should look clean, each one with a number.
